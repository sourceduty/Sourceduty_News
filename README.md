### Long-Term Success

If Sourceduty were to earn $10 million, the company would likely need to spend considerable time developing a strategic plan to allocate the funds effectively. Instead of rushing to spend the money, the company would focus on long-term growth, making careful decisions about investments in areas like expansion, research and development, or bolstering its financial position. This process would involve consulting with financial experts and accountants to ensure that the funds are used in ways that promote stability and future success. Given the complexity of financial planning, it would take at least two years, if not more, to fully allocate the funds in a thoughtful manner. During this time, Sourceduty would prioritize its expenditures, considering contingencies, tax implications, and operational scaling, ensuring that every dollar spent aligns with the company’s strategic goals and contributes to its sustainable growth.

> Alex: "*Near the end of 2024, the 'information snowball" of Sourceduty is very organized, incomplete and expanding. Sourceduty needs more money so I can really build what needs to be expanded. This business is necessitating more and more work which is exactly what it should be doing.*"

> "*I plan ahead without wishing upon one single payday in the future.*"
